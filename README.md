# Jared's dotfiles

- Useful scripts in `~/.local/bin/`
- Settings for:
	- nvim (text editor)
	- zsh (shell)
	- sxhkd (general key binder)
	- mpd (music)
	- khal (calendar program)
	- khard (contacts program)
	- vdirsync (carddav caldav syncer)
	- some systemd stuff
	- other stuff like xdg default programs, picom and more, etc.
- I try to minimize what's directly in `~` so:
	- All configs that can be in `~/.config/` are.
	- Some environmental variables have been set in `~/.pam_environment` to move configs into `~/.config/` and historys to `~/.local/share/`
